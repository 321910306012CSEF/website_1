<h1>This is about MSD

**_MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI_**, the best captain of _INDIAN_ cricket was born on _7th July 1981_ to **_PAN SINGH and DEVAKI_**. He was selected into the national team in *2003*, after struggling to get a chance and serving as a TC in the railway department. Though a chance given, luck did not favor him, his whole series against _BANGLADESH_ was not so notable. The courageous decision of **_DADA @SOURAV GANGULY_**, to push **_MSD_** up the order made him show his full potential and hit his _maiden hundred(124 not out)_. From there he went on to hit the _highest ODI_ score by a wicketkeeper-batsman in the world, **_183 not out_**. In 2007, with the effect of a demotivating loss to Bangladesh in the group stage knock-out game, India wanted to give the seniors a break. The management wanted a team of youngsters to travel to South Africa, to be a part of the inaugural T20 WC. And the team was to be captained by.................... ***_CAPTAIN MSD_***.

_Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni_ made a huge impact on how a captain can turn around a cricket match with his wisdom. He showed people that he's capable of doing something huge by winning _a thrilling T20 WC final against the art rivals of India, PAKISTAN_. After this, he went on to captain the ODI and test teams too. He made India the _top cricketing nation in tests for 2 consecutive years_. 

Then _the phenomenal_ came, INDIA was doing par good in the 2011 ICC ODI WC, the finals of which was to be held in The **_WANKANDE STADIUM_**, Mumbai. India lost 2 quick wickets later when the young lad _VIRAT_ along with GAMBHIR started giving some stability. VIRAT was dismissed by a spectacular catch by DILSHAND.YUVRAJ was ready to come, where MSD tried to do a gamble, coming ahead of YUVI, the performer of the tournament, _MSD saved the match and brought the honour of that golden ODI cup to India after 28 years_.

Later to the great win at WANKHANDE, MSD along with another young team went to **_ENGLAND_**. Playing so deterministically, from the practice matches, _INDIA won the ICC CHAMPIONS TROPHY in 2013 at Oldtrafferd_. MSD turned to be **_the only captain to win all the ICC trophies along with the Asia cup_**. MSD after a very good career in tests as captain and player stepped down from the captaincy and _left tests in December 2014_. Later in _January 2017_, he gave the throne of honour, **_Captaincy to VIRAT KOHLI_**. **_On August 15th 2019_**, ***An era of destructive hitting, an era of lightning stumping, an era of masterpiece captaincy ended. The greatest captain and one of the greatest players, a legend of INDIAN Cricket left the Blues.*** <h1>
