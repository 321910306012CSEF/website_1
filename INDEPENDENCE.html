The central government has revealed a new website for the 75th Independence Day celebrations this year -- indianidc2021.mod.gov.in. The website was launched by defence secretary Dr Ajay Kumar on August 3 to mark the upcoming Independence Day 2021 celebrations, according to a government release. The website will serve as a platform to connect Indians all over the world to celebrate the national festival, the release stated, adding that a mobile app for the Independence Day Celebrations (IDC), 2021, will soon be launched as well.


To achieve this purpose, the website is integrating for the first time ever virtual reality (VR) feature to show off the Independence Day celebrations from the Red Fort in New Delhi in a 360-degree format. People can use this feature even without having a VR gadget, the government release said.

The Independence Day celebration platform also provides a host of other features, including a special IDC radio, gallery, interactive filters, e-books on deeds of gallantry, 50 years of 1971 victory, and blogs on the freedom movement, wars and war memorials.
